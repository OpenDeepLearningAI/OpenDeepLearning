# Introduction to Large Language Models 

### What is a Language Model?


Language models are a type of machine learning model designed to comprehend and generate human language. Their operation revolves around the identification of patterns within extensive sets of textual data.
A language model might analyze millions of news articles and books, discerning connections between words by examining their frequent co-occurrence, identifying the tonal nuances of specific phrases, and determining suitable word placements at the beginning or end of sentences.

It's like if you read a stack of magazines cover to cover - you'd pick up on language rules and vocabulary even without thinking hard. Language models do this on a massive scale to learn languages.

After this training process, they can predict upcoming words as you type a sentence. They get better at finishing phrases or answering questions as they digest more text. Advanced models can even create coherent stories or summaries on their own! like GPT-4 or Gemini.

Under the hood,  these models assign probabilities to words and combinations of words that they have encountered before. Their operation involves estimating the probability of a token or a sequence of tokens appearing within a longer sequence of tokens. Consider the following sentence:

```js copy 
As the spaceship landed on Mars, the crew noticed [MASK] on the surface.
```

The model has encountered many texts describing Mars landings before. It computes the likelihoods for various words to fill in the `[MASK]` by examining the tokens that most frequently appear in comparable contexts within those texts. For example, in the [Fill-Mask](https://huggingface.co/tasks/fill-mask) sentence above, the model may compute probabilities like:

```js copy
something 0.205 (20.5%)
nothing 0.110 (11.0%)
movement 0.081 (8.1%)
blood 0.049 (4.9%)
dust 0.044 (4.4%)
...
```

These percentages come from all the previous usage examples the model has tracked. It aggregates statistics about how often terms occurred after crew noticing things on Mars in source texts.

The probabilities relate directly to the raw counts and frequencies detected in the model's training data. If `"dust"` appeared 44 times out of 1,000 total Mars landing descriptions, then 0.044 reflects that historical frequency.
This ability for language models to rank possibilities based on apparent likelihoods extracted from large datasets allows generating or completing text reflecting realistic patterns.

### What is a Large Language Model?

A large language model (LLM) is an AI system trained on massive textual data to acquire advanced abilities in generating, comprehending, and reasoning about language.

Over the past few years, there has been remarkable growth in the size and capabilities of language models. While early models comprised thousands or millions of parameters, today's massive language models boast billions or even trillions of parameters. This expansion is driven by continuous improvements in computer memory, dataset sizes, processing power, and the development of more effective approaches for capturing extended text sequences.

As these models continue to grow in size, their complexity and efficacy also rise. Early language models could predict the probability of individual words, while modern large language models have the capability to forecast the likelihood of entire sentences, paragraphs, or even complete documents.

Despite these advancements, the development of exceptionally large models demands substantial computational resources for training. Organizations with access to high-performance hardware, expertise in efficient methodologies, and extensive datasets gain a competitive edge in scaling up massive language models.

### LLM Considerations

LLMs have gained tremendous popularity and utility in various applications, but they are not without their drawbacks. It's important to consider both the advantages and limitations of LLMs to make informed decisions about their use. Here are some drawbacks of LLMs:

- LLMs may amplify biases from training data, emphasizing the need for careful consideration in training and deployment.
- Potential for misuse, generating fake news, and unethical content creation.
- Models may lack true common sense understanding, resulting in inaccuracies.
- Models trained on general data may not perform well in specialized domains.
- Risk of overfitting, leading to poor performance on new, unseen data.
