### Open-source LLMs

Open-source Large Language Models provide a versatile foundation for AI development. These models can be fine-tuned for specialized tasks, such as prompt generation or medical applications, offering flexibility and innovation opportunities across various domains, enhancing natural language processing capabilities.

### Closed source LLMs

Closed Source LLMs are proprietary language models known for their confidential source code and architecture. Unlike open-source counterparts, these models keep their internal workings private. This approach offers enhanced data security and control over intellectual property, making them suitable for industries like healthcare, finance, and legal services where data privacy and confidentiality are paramount.
