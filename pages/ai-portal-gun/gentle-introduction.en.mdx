### Prerequisites

Before delving into the realm of machine learning, it is crucial to establish a solid foundation in Python programming. Python stands as the preferred language for machine learning practitioners, noted for its versatility and user-friendliness, making it an ideal choice for beginners. If you have not done so already, we strongly recommend commencing your journey with the [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) by Jake VanderPlas. This excellent book comprehensively covers fundamental Python concepts essential for ML, including libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas.

Furthermore, if you prefer a video-based learning approach over a book, you may consider the courses [Python Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg&list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7), [Matplotlib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO98lJQ3QGI&list=PL-osiE80TeTvipOqomVEeZ1HRrcEvtZB_) and [Pandas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyhVh-qRZPA&list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS) by Corey Schaer for the former and stick to the book for learning [NumPy](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/#2.-Introduction-to-NumPy). Learning NumPy might require a few hours, so opting for the book is a prudent choice in this case.
Once you're comfortable with Python, you'll be ready to explore the exciting universe of ML.
